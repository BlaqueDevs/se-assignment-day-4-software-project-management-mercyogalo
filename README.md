Cost control ensures projects stay within budget and avoid overruns. Strategies include accurate estimation, tracking expenses, controlling scope creep, and having contingency plans.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Waterfall: Structured, best for fixed requirements.
Pros: Clear stages, easy to manage.
Cons: Inflexible.

Agile: Flexible, best for evolving projects.
Pros: Adaptable, quick releases.
Cons: Less predictability.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile: Best for evolving software projects (e.g., app development).
Waterfall: Best for fixed requirements (e.g., construction).

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods include code reviews, unit testing, integration testing, and CI/CD. Maintaining high standards ensures reliability and user satisfaction.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining scope ensures clear objectives. WBS breaks the project into manageable tasks, helping with organization and progress tracking.
